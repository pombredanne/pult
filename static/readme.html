<h1>Pult</h1>

<p>Pult ( <em>i.e &quot;remote controller&quot; in estonian</em> ) is <em>HTML5</em> app that turns any device that can run modern web browser into a classic game controller. 
It&#39;s designed for mobilephones with touchscreens, but it works also on a desktop or on a raspberryPI with keyboard.</p>

<p>I like to play retrogames and a laptop is not the most comfortable gaming device and believe me 8bit games look much better on 27&quot; screen or projector - pixels are bigger. So i built this app to get away from a laptop, stream a laptop screen onto a bigger screen and play on a couch.</p>

<p>Plus it has longer range than you average USB remote controller, easy to switch keyboard mappings and it makes it possible to games with team.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Using the app should be simple:</p>

<ul><li><p>open <code>index.html</code> on modern browser. FxOS owner has much more choices: install it with FirefoxIDE or via app-store.</p></li><li><p>check does a correct keymapping in an app configuration is activated</p></li><li>activate your WIFI</li><li>connect to <code>pult-server</code> running on your laptop.</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tauho/pult-server"><code>Pult-server</code></a> is web-server that listen incoming messages from pult-app and turns them into native keyboard actions.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Pult is currently in alpha stage:</p>

<ul><li>full of technical debts - will be solved in the next release <code>0.2</code></li><li>a lag is bigger than it should be - planned for <code>0.3</code></li><li>design is made by programmer - will be solved in <code>?</code></li><li>no localization yet</li><li>documentation is in stage &quot;send me email with your questions&quot;;</li></ul>

<p>It&#39;s my personal fun project and i made code publicly available so you can also learn more about Clojurescript and maybe fix some bugs, open tickets - it&#39;s much more effective than trolling on app-store;</p>

<p>The sourcecode is available on github <a href="https://github.com/tauho/pult">https://github.com/tauho/pult</a>.
